== Beer Garden in a Nutshell

Beer Garden makes it easy to turn your functions into fully functional ReST interfaces that are ready for production use.  In short, the goal is to take anybody that knows how to write a function, and create all the other boilerplate code for them. This includes backing that function by a type-safe, discoverable, ReST interface and a fully functional web form-based interface that is easy-to-use for developers and end-users alike.

== Requirements

Beer Garden depends on a few external services and requires the following to run:

* Python (2.7 or >= 3.5)
* Connectivity to MongoDB (>= 3.2.0)
* Connectivity to RabbitMQ (>= 3)

== Installation

Beer Garden can be installed using `pip`, `yum`, `docker` or `docker-compose`. Check out our link:docs/installation-guides/[Installation Guides] for more information on the different ways to install Beer Garden.

TIP: You probably noticed that beer-garden needs MongoDB and RabbitMQ to work. That's why we recommend using `docker-compose` if you want to get up and running quickly - the compose configuration will handle those things for you.
