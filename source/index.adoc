== beer-garden in a Nutshell

beer-garden makes it easy to create composable pieces of software with a very
minimal understanding of best-practices for writing software. In short, the
goal is to take a developer that knows how to write a function, and create all
the other boilerplate code for him/her. beer-garden has some defaults for how
to render the code you write as an HTML form.

== Requirements

beer-garden runs on Linux and needs a couple things to work:

* Python (2.7 or >= 3.5)
* Connectivity to MongoDB (>= 3.2.0)
* Connectivity to RabbitMQ

== Installation

beer-garden can be installed using `pip`, `yum`, `docker` or `docker-compose`. Check out our link:docs/installation-guides/[Installation Guides] for more information on the different ways to install beer-garden.

TIP: You probably noticed that beer-garden needs MongoDB and RabbitMQ to work. That's why we recommend using `docker-compose` if you want to get up and running quickly - the compose configuration will handle those things for you.
