In this guide, we will go over the configuration options in beer-garden and how they affect the application. We will talk about the configuration at a high level, but we assume you have installed beer-garden somehow.

== Configuration Files ==

There are 4 configuration files that come installed with beer-garden. If you installed an RPM, you will find these in `{rpm-config-home}` otherwise you can generate them through the commands `brew-view` and `bartender` provide. The default names are:

* `{bt-config}`
* `{bt-log-config}`
* `{bv-config}`
* `{bv-log-config}`

== Logging Configuration ==

The logging configuration uses the standard python logging information. This can be edited as you see fit. If nothing is specified, beer-garden will fall back to some basic defaults. You can generate a logging file through:

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
generate_bartender_log_config -l {bt-log-config}
generate_brew_view_log_config -l {bv-log-config}
----

== Bartender Configuration ==

If you do not have a `{bt-config}` file, then you can generate one via:

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
generate_bartender_config -c {bt-config}
----

If you already have a `{bt-config}` file, then you can upgrade it to the latest version via:

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
migrate_bartender_config -c {bt-config}
----

== Plugin Logging Configuration ==

As of beer-garden 2.1.0, there is a new configuration file for plugin logging configurations. If this file is not included, a logging configuration is inferred from the logging configuration of the beer-garden application itself. This logging configuration specifies how you would like plugins to log. A valid logging configuration can be found in `brew-view/dev_conf/example-plugin-logging-config.json`. Let's examine what is allowed to go into this configuration.

=== Level
You may specify a default level that you would like all plugins to log at. This can be overwritten by `handlers`, or `loggers` entries. The supported levels are:

* `DEBUG`
* `INFO`
* `WARN`
* `ERROR`

===  Handlers

The `handlers` section is a dictionary which may contain one of the following keys:

* `stdout`
* `file`
* `logstash`

Each of these keys can have their own configuration and can be overwritten in the `loggers` section. Other handlers are not yet supported.

=== Formatters

The `formatters` section is also a dictionary. Its keys must match up with a specific handler name or the name `default`. Here you can setup a special formatter for each of the individual handlers. The `handlers` should specify which `formatter` they would like to use.

=== Loggers
The `loggers` section allows you to specify a different logger per system name. If you wanted to customize the logger for a system called `foo` you could create an entry in the loggers section that looks like the following:

[source,json]
----
{
  "foo": {
    "level": "WARN",
    "handlers": ["stdout"],
    "formatters": {"stdout": "%(message)s"}
  }
}
----

This tells beer-garden that when a system with the name `foo` asks for its logging configuration, that we should use this specialized configuration.
