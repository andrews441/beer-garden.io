To review what's happening here, we add the import for `RemotePlugin` to the top of our file, then create a main method that will simply create a `HelloWorldClient` object. Then we pass the object into the `RemotePlugin` which takes an object, a name of the plugin, plugin version, description and a few more things.  That's all the code you need to get started. Now we just need to move on to configuration.

NOTE: A quick note on multi-threading. If you set `max_concurrent=5` in the initializers, you are inherently saying that your functions are thread safe and can be processed in multiple threads (a maximum of 5 can run). It is up to the plugin developer to determine/create a plugin that can actually operate in a multi-threaded fashion.
