In order to build a plugin you'll need a functioning Python environment. Setting that up is outside the scope of this tutorial; we recommend https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv]. You'll also need access to a functioning Beer Garden. Check out the link:{uri-install-guides}[installation instructions] for ways to stand up your own Beer Garden.

The simplest way to get started is to use the utility package we've created to make plugin building as easy as possible. The package is called `brewtils` and lives on our PyPi server. You can find link:{brewtils_docs_uri}[Brewtils API Documentation here]. Add it to your environment like this:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
pip install brewtils
----

CAUTION: Due to some bugs in how pip does special character substitution we recommend using version 9.0.0 or later. Use `pip install -U pip` to install the newest version.
