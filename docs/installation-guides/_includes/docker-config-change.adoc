Open up the `conf/bartender-config.json` file and find the line that looks like this:

    "amq_publish_host": "CHANGE_ME_PLEASE",

Change `CHANGE_ME_PLEASE` to the IP address of your system.

----
"amq_publish_host": "WWW.XXX.YYY.ZZZ",
----

CAUTION: Make sure to use a real IP address and not 'localhost' or '0.0.0.0'.

TIP: You can also use a fully-qualified domain name instead of an IP address.
