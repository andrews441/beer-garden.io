Run this command to start beer-garden:

     docker-compose up -d

This will create the necessary docker containers and then run them in the background. Run the following command to see the log output from the containers starting:

     docker-compose logs -f

Look for a line that says "Bartender started" - once you see that beer-garden is up and running. Use `ctrl-c` to exit.

beer-garden starts by default on port 2337, so point a browser at `http://<IP-ADDRESS>:2337` (where `<IP-ADDRESS>` is the address you used for the previous step). You'll see a message saying beer-garden couldn't find any   systems. Don't worry - you're about to add one.
